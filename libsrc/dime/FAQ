Question 1: Where are the rendering methods?
============================================

Short answer:

    Nowhere.

Long answer:

    The dime library is mostly focused on supporting the DXF file format
    so you can exchange data with other 3D systems (e.g. AutoCAD) through
    it, and does not contain code for rendering the data.  The intention
    of the library is that you should have some other retain-mode rendering
    library for 3D models, like Open Inventor, Optimizer, or Performer,
    and use dime to load DXF files and then move the geometry data into
    the library designed for rendering.  If you want to save models using
    the DXF file format, you move the geometry data the other way.


Question 2: What about support for other file formats?
======================================================

Short answer:

    Beta support for dxb has recently been added.  For AutoCAD dwg support,
    see www.opendwg.org.

Long answer:

    To support other file formats, the format must be structurally very
    similar to the AutoCAD .dxf file format.  AutoCAD .dxb is one such
    format, but it is hardly used by anyone.  The AutoCAD .dwg format
    could potensially be a candidate, but the file format seems too complex.
    Check out opendwg.org if you need support for .dwg files.
