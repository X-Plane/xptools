	NOTE:  WED_GisLine has a constant number of points, so it does not cache its bounding box.  If we find that we have a performance problem
	we can add this, but since the access time to find the real bounding box is a constant-multiple of the cache time, it seems unlikely
	that caching is needed.  (Unlike a taxiway with 800 points.)
