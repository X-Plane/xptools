/*

	WED_GISEdge - an EDGE is topologically different from a chain (see WED_GISChain).  WED_GISChain is a 
	(possibly closed) sequence of points - each point is a child of the chain.
	
	BY comparison, WED_GISEdge represents a topological link in a network.  That is - its two terminal 
	end-points are _not_ it's children, but rather external classes (managed as "sources").  This makes
	it possible for two WED_GISEdges to share common end-nodes, forming a topological network.
	
	Our direct children form "shape" points - that is, points that change the path of the edge without
	having topological meaning.
