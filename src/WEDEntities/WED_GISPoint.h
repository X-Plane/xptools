/*
	WED_GISPoint - THEORY OF OPERATION

	WED_GISPoint (and the other WED_GISxxxx classes) are intermediate implementations that provide
	the "spatial brains" for various WED classes.

	WED_GISPoint implements the IGISPoint, forming a single point specified in latitude and longitude.

	Specific WED entities are formed from these intermediates, picking up their "GIS brains" for free
	and adding some special properties or behavior.
