/*
	IPropertyObject - THEORY OF OPERATION

	This is a simple interface that lets client UI code "edit" an object by named properties, which are self-described in a format
	adequate for UI presentation.  The idea here is to describe the datamodel - not to spec UI.  At least, that's my rationalization.
