	GUI_Commander - THEORY OF OPERATION

	GUI_Commander represents the chain of keyboard and command focus.  (Commands are expected to be issued to the same
	location as keystrokes - that is, their destination  must be inferred because the device creating the commands doesn't
	have natural spatial info to find a pane the way a mouse click does.)

	While commanders sit in a tree, this is a SEPARATE tree from the GUI pane structure.  You can mix a pane tree and
	commander tree, but please note that there doesn't have to be a direct correspondence.

	One exception is that windows are ALWAYS the root of both pane and commander trees!

	DEFERMENT
	
	There's a nasty category of bugs that can occur: while the user cannot easily do two commands at once with the mouse
	(e.g. select while moving an object) because there is only one left mouse button) the user CAN do two things at once
	by running a command off the keyboard while editign with the mouse.
	
	We provide an API to _defer_ command processing until later - other code can thus tell commands to 'go wait' until we
	are ready to accept them.  The GUI_Window mouse code uses this to defer commands while drags are in place to avoid 
	double-commanding.

	MEMORY MANAGEMENT

	Because commanders are meant to be mix-ins for other classes, and very often at least some of those classes WILL be
	panes, commanders do not attempt any memory management!
