GeoJasPer 1.3.1 (GeoTiff <-> GeoJP2(tm) GeoJPEG2000 )

GeoJasper is a Geo supporting transcoder based on enhanced jasper library 
(i.e., it converts image data from one format to another) 
correctly transferring geo information between GeoTiff and GeoJP2(tm).

It supports striped as well as tiled TIFF images. Moreover it may combine
three 1 band TIFFs into one RGB image. If TIFF file is accompanied by TFW 
(The World File), with the same name and .tfw extension, then it's 
geographical information will be used instead of the embedded GeoTiff one.
GeoJasper can handle images with more than 3  channels and 8/16 bits  per 
channel, also it can create tiled TIFF images as well as convert  striped 
TIFF into tiled TIFF.

What's new:

[1.3.1] by Dmitry
FIX: TIFF writing: support for images of arbitrary bit rates 
     (>1  and <=8  goes to 8  bits per plane)
     (>8  and <=16 goes to 16 bits per plane)
     (>16 and <=32 goes to 32 bits per plane)
FIX: Memory leak in jpeg encoder indicated by GYache team 
     <http://gyachi.sourceforge.net/download.shtml>   

[1.3.0] by Dmitry (beta testing by: Greg Coats and Dirk Hildebrandt)
NEW: Support to read/write 16bit images preserving the bit rate. 
     i.e. 16 bit TIFF will produce 16 bit JPEG2000 and vice versa;
NEW: Support to write tiled tiffs and updated support for reading tiled TIFFs;
NEW: Read/write support for images with more than 3 channels for JPEG2000 and TIFF;
FIX: Errors reading tiled JPEG2000 images produced by Photoshop CS2 and kdu_compress.
Updated libraries:
  libtiff:    3.8.2
  libgeotiff: 1.2.3
  libproj:    4.4.9

[1.2.9] by Dmitry (beta testing by: Greg Coats)
NEW: Added functionality for -listgeo argument. It now prints projection names
and tie-points (corners) are also shown in Lat/Long. 
To make this happen the library was extended adding Proj.4 library and compiling
into the code projection database from libgeotiff.

[1.2.8] Assembled by Greg Coats
IMPROVED: Decoding/Encoding speed is dramatically improved by changes in QMFB code
by Kaspar Daugaard and Greg Coats.
Here we do have some considerations regarding the buffer size, 
even though the selected size of 128 should perform perfectly the better
result can be achieved on specific platforms. e.g. on p4 machine
with intel compiler the block of size 256 performed better.
The appropriate change can be made in the file:
./src/libjasper/jpc/jpc_qmfb.c
changing the size of #define JPC_BATCH_SIZE 128 

[1.2.6]
FIX: Corrected wrong decoding RGB tiled TIFF images. Bug in the height of 
the last tile if it's less then tile size. Thanks to Greg Coats for 
identifying the problem!

[1.2.5]

1.2 Command line

The jasper command converts image data from one format to another. In other words, this command functions
as a general-purpose transcoder. Since the JPEG-2000 format is supported by this software, it can be used as
a JPEG-2000 encoder and/or decoder.

Options
The jasper program accepts the following options:

--help
Print usage information and exit.

--version
Print the version and exit.

--input file
-f file
Read the input image from the file named file. By default, the input image is read from standard input.

--input-format format
-t format
Specify the format of the input image as format. In most circumstances, this option should not be
needed, as the format is normally autodetected by examining the image data directly or deduced from
the input file name extension if an input file is specified (via the --input option).

--input-option option
-o option
Provide the option option to the decoder. The valid values for the argument option are determined by
the input image format. See below for more details.

--output file
-F file
Write the encoded image to the file named file. By default, the encoded image is written to standard
output.

--output-format format
-T format
Produce the output image in the format indicated by format. The output format must be specified if
an output file is not given (via the ”–output” option). If an output file is given and no output format is
specified, an attempt will be made to deduce the correct format from the output file name extension.

--output-option option
-O option
Provide the option option to the encoder. The valid values for the argument option are determined by
the output format. See below for more details.

--verbose
Enable verbose mode.

--force-srgb
Force the image to be converted to the sRGB color space before encoding. As a side effect, the image
will also be homogenously sampled (i.e., all components are sampled at the same points on the
reference grid).

The argument format must have one of the following values:
Value Description
bmp - Windows BMP
jp2 - JPEG-2000 JP2, GeoJp2(TM)
jpc - JPEG-2000 Code Stream
jpg - JPEG
pgx - PGX
pnm - PNM/PGM/PPM
mif - My Image Format
ras - Sun Rasterfile
tif - Tagged Image File Format, GeoTIFF

*****************************************************************************
Examples
*****************************************************************************

1. Suppose that we have an image stored in the PNM/PPM format in a file called lena.ppm. To encode
this image (losslessly) in the JPEG-2000 JP2 format, and store the result in a file called lena.jp2,
type:
jasper --input lena.ppm --output lena.jp2 --output-format jp2
Or, alternately (using short option names), type:
jasper -f lena.ppm -F lena.jp2 -T jp2

2. Suppose that we have a RGB color image stored in the JPEG-2000 JP2 format in a file called lena.jp2.
To encode this image in the PNM/PPM format, and store the result in a file called lena.ppm, type:
jasper --input lena.jp2 --output lena.ppm --output-format pnm
Or, alternately (using short option names), type:
jasper -f lena.jp2 -F lena.ppm -T pnm

3. Suppose that we have an image stored in the BMP format in a file called lena.bmp. To encode this
image in a lossy manner at 100:1 compression in the JPEG-2000 (code stream) format, and store the
result in a file called lena_lossy.jpc, type:
jasper -f lena.bmp -F lena_lossy.jpc -T jpc -O rate=0.01

4. Suppose that we have an image stored in a file called sachie.pnm in the PNM/PPM format, and we
want to encode the image in the JPEG-2000 (code stream) format and store the result in a file named
sachie_new.jpc. Further, suppose that we want the JPEG-2000 format to employ the following
parameters:
* code blocks are 64 samples in width and 32 samples in height
* no multicomponent transform is to be employed
* 4 resolution levels should be employed for each component
* the compression is lossy at 64:1
In order to accomplish the above, type:
jasper -f sachie.pnm -F sachie_new.jpc -T jpc -O cblkwidth=64 -O cblkheight=32
-O nomct -O numrlvls=4 -O rate=0.015625

JPEG2000 encoder/decoder options
*****************************************************************************

JP2 Codec
One of the two image formats specified in the JPEG-2000 Part-1 standard (i.e., ISO/IEC 15444-1 [8]) is the
so called “JP2” format.

Encoder Options
The encoder supports all of the same options as the JPC encoder.
Decoder Options
The decoder supports all of the same options as the JPC decoder.

JPC Codec

One of the two image formats specified in the JPEG-2000 Part-1 standard (i.e., ISO/IEC 15444-1 [8]) is the
so called JPEG-2000 code stream format. The JPC codec in JasPer implements this format.
The design of the JPEG-2000 codec implementation was driven by several key concerns: execution speed,
memory usage, robustness, portability, modularity, maintainability, and extensibility. In some cases, however,
during the design process, modularity, portability, and understandability of the code were weighed more
heavily than execution speed and memory usage. Code understandability and portability were critical considerations
since this software was intended to be used as a reference implementation of the JPEG-2000 Part-1
codec in the JPEG-2000 Part-5 standard [10].
Since the JPEG-2000 standard does not specify any means for encoding color space information in a
JPEG-2000 code stream, the decoder must make certain assupmtions about the color space of an image. If
accurate color representation is important, the JPEG-2000 code stream format should not be employed. The
JPEG-2000 JP2 format should be used instead.

-------------------
Encoder Options
-------------------

The following options are supported by the encoder:

imgareatlx=x
Set the x-coordinate of the top-left corner of the image area to x.

imgareatly=y
Set the y-coordinate of the top-left corner of the image area to y.

tilegrdtlx=x
Set the x-coordinate of the top-left corner of the tiling grid to x.

tilegrdtly=y
Set the y-coordinate of the top-left corner of the tiling grid to y.

tilewidth=w
Set the nominal tile width to w.

tileheight=h
Set the nominal tile height to h.

prcwidth=w
Set the precinct width to w. The argument w must be an integer power of two. The default value is
32768.

prcheight=h
Set the precinct height to h. The argument h must be an integer power of two. The default value is
32768.

cblkwidth=w
Set the nominal code block width to w. The argument w must be an integer power of two. The default
value is 64.

cblkheight=h
Set the nominal code block height to h. The argument h must be an integer power of two. The default
value is 64.

mode=m
Set the coding mode to m. The argument m must have one of the following values:
Value Description: 
  int - integer mode
  real - real mode

If lossless coding is desired, the integer mode must be used. By default, the integer mode is employed.
The choice of mode also determines which multicomponent and wavelet transforms (if any) are employed.

rate=r
Specify the target rate. The argument r is a positive real number. Since a rate of one corresponds to no
compression, one should never need to explicitly specify a rate greater than one. By default, the target
rate is considered to be infinite.
ilyrrates=r0[,r1,. . . ,rN

vcausal
Use vertically stripe causal contexts.

pterm
Use predictable termination.

resetprob
Reset the probability models after each coding pass.

numgbits=n
Set the number of guard bits to n.


-------------------
Decoder Options
-------------------

The decoder does not support any special options.

Rate Specification
All rates are specified in terms of compression factors (i.e., as reciprocals of compression ratio) and not as
actual bit rates! Although image coding folks frequently use the number of bits per pixel to specify rate,
this quantity is often inconvenient to use when dealing with images that have differing sample precisions.
Furthermore, the number of bits per pixel is not well defined for multicomponent images with distinct subsampling
factors. The compression factor, however, is independent of sample precision and well defined for
all types of images. For these reasons, JasPer uses the compression factor and not the number of bits per pixel
to specify rates.

-------------------
JPG Codec
-------------------

For lossy coding, one of the most popular image formats is specified in the JPEG standard (i.e., ISO/IEC
10918-1 [2]). In JasPer, the JPG codec implements this format.
The JPEG support in JasPer requires the JPEG library from the Independent JPEG Group (IJG). For legal
reasons, the IJG JPEG library source code is not included with JasPer. The source code for this library can
be downloaded from the IJG web site (i.e., http://www.ijg.org).

Encoder Options
The following options are supported by the encoder:

quality=q
Set the quality factor to q. This is used in order to indirectly control the bit rate for lossy coding.

Decoder Options
The decoder does not support any special options.
